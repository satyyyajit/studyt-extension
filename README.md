# StudYT - A YouTube Focus Extension

**StudYT** is a Chrome extension designed to help users remove distractions on YouTube and focus on studying or other productive tasks. It automatically hides recommendations, comments, and the sidebar, ensuring a cleaner and distraction-free interface.

---

## Features
- Removes YouTube recommendations (right-side video suggestions).
- Removes comments section.
- Removes the sidebar menu (subscriptions, library, etc.).
- Works seamlessly for the current video and any subsequent videos (handles dynamic navigation).
- Toggle between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode** for the extension popup.

---

## How It Works
1. **Content Script**: Removes distractions by targeting and hiding specific YouTube elements.
2. **MutationObserver**: Monitors DOM changes for dynamic updates (e.g., navigating to a new video).
3. **URL Change Detection**: Ensures distraction removal when the user navigates within YouTube without reloading the page.
